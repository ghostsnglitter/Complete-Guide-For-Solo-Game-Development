# Pre-Production

During Pre-Production, you are going to hash out the most important design decisions. This is done through an iterative process of design and prototyping. You will also consider the resources that will be needed and draw up a plan for the realisation of your game - including an initial timeline - so that you can move on to Production.

## 1. Setting Up A Backlog

A central element of the development of your game is the backlog. It serves as a neccessary project management framework, hosting all of the important design documents, all tasks that need to get done, and providing a project timeline with milestones and due dates.

Because we are about to create important design documents, it makes sense to set up the backlog already. There are different project management applications that can be used for this, but my personal pick is [ClickUp](https://www.clickup.com/):

It is extremely feature-rich and customizable (even the free version). This might make it a bit too much for your first project though, so feel free to use alternatives for your own backlog (i've heard about [Nuclino](https://nuclino.com/), [Milanote](https://milanote.com/) and others).

To begin with, you really only need to *create a dedicated space for your game project, with the ability to add documents and tasks as you go along* (you should start by integrating the Game Concept designed in the previous phase). The specifics of the backlog structure can vary drastically depending on what type of game you are making. Still, if you are going with ClickUp, [here](https://app.clickup.com/template/project/t-90040105296/d6e92afd78aea9a) you can find a template for a space dedicated to the `SLINGSHOT` project used as an example earlier. Once again, consider getting a little help organizing stuff from [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat):
