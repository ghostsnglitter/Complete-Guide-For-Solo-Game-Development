# Concept Phase

In the Concept Phase, you will funnel your many ideas into a single, clearly defined game concept and critically evaluate it. If you are satisfied, you will make the commitment to move into Pre-Production.

## 1. Collecting Game Ideas

A game idea is just that - an idea, like `"2D game where you can perform a slingshot move by clicking and dragging the player character"`. There are no specifics required at this stage.

### 1.1 Brainstorming

If you are planning on using this guide for your own game project, you probably already have one or even many different game ideas in your head. If not, a focused brainstorming session can help you collect as many game ideas as possible or play around with different variations of the same idea. A good web-app for brainstorming is [Kinopio](https://kinopio.club/):

It serves as a virtual whiteboard and can help you organize and connect ideas visually. I mostly use it temporarily for mind-mapping and instead collect the most promising game ideas as notes in my [OneNote]() notebook (which i use for other stuff, too). This makes it easier to quiklcy write down ideas on my mobile phone.

### 1.2 Inspiration

Personally, i often can't stop my brain from constantly producing new game ideas, but sometimes everyone gets stuck. So if you need help coming up with ideas, consider the following approaches:
- *Play games*: Start by playing a wide variety of games, from different genres and platforms. Analyze what you enjoy about each game and what makes it unique. Consider how you could incorporate these elements into your own game.
- *Identify a problem to solve*: Think about problems that you or others face in their daily lives. This could be anything from a lack of motivation to exercise to difficulty in learning a new language. Brainstorm ways that a game could help solve this problem.
- *Look for inspiration in other media*: Draw inspiration from books, movies, and TV shows. Consider how you could adapt a particular story or concept into a game.
- *Explore new technology*: Keep up-to-date with new technology and innovations in the gaming industry. Consider how new hardware, such as virtual reality headsets or haptic feedback controllers, could be used to create new gaming experiences.
- *Consider your own passions and interests*: Think about your own hobbies and interests. Consider how you could incorporate these into a game. For example, if you enjoy hiking, you could create a game that simulates a hiking adventure.
- *Combine different ideas*: Try combining different ideas to create something unique. For example, you could combine a puzzle game with a platformer or a survival game with a city-builder.
- *Collaborate with others*: Brainstorm with others and collaborate on game ideas. Consider working with people from different backgrounds and skill sets, such as artists or programmers.
- *Think about your target audience*: Consider who you want to make games for and what they would enjoy. Think about the age group, interests, and gaming experience of your target audience.

## 2. Creating A Game Concept

It is time to create a specific game concept. This means you will need to choose a single game idea that you want to work out more thoroughly. Although the game concept will still only be a very short summary, with it you are laying the foundation for everything that follows (_spoilers_, what follows is a lot of work) and i have seen indie developers create stunning art and impressive tech demos for projects that they ultimately had to cancel, because they didn't have a solid game concept.

A game concept should be less than one page in length. It should contain an *Overview* of the game's idea, a short list of the most important and unique *Gameplay Mechanics*, a brief description of the game's *Story* or *Narrative* (alternatively *Progression* for non-narrative games), a definition of the *Target Audience*, as well as the targetted *Platforms*. Every one of these elements is extremely important when presenting your idea to someone. No matter how experimental and artsy your game is, your game concept should cover all of these elements. However, the exact format varies and should be adjusted to what best suits your particular game idea.

If you need help, you might want to try turning your game idea into a concept by iterating on some creative and concise prompts to ask [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat):

> If you have trouble turning a vague game idea into a concrete concept, you should consider that as a warning sign - not because the idea is worthless, but because you should not move any further into the development process before figuring out a concept. Seriously. Take your time, let the idea grow in the back of your mind while you're working on something else. Instead of breaking your head about this one idea, consider going back to the [previous step](#collecting-game-ideas).

## 3. Evaluating The Concept

Now that you have a game concept, there is one last evaluation to go through before moving into Pre-Production. Especially for solo game development, it can be an extremely important step, as it might be the last chance to find some critical shortcomings of your concept before wasting a ton of time on it.

In order to evaluate the concept, answer all of the following questions: [^1]

[^1]: These questions are derived from Warren Spector's GDC talk ["Classic Game Postmortem: Deus Ex"](https://youtu.be/tffX3VljTtI).

1. What is the *core of the game idea*? Start by identifying the central gameplay mechanic or concept that makes your game idea unique. This will serve as the foundation for the rest of the game's design.
2. How *well-suited is the idea to games* as a medium? Consider how well the game idea lends itself to being translated into a game. For example, if your game idea is heavily focused on narrative, ask yourself if it would be better suited to a different medium, such as a book or film.
3. What is the *player fantasy*? Think about the experience that the player will have while playing the game. What fantasy or role-playing experience will they be able to live out?
4. Why do you want to make *this game specifically*? Identify what you hope to achieve with this game. Are you aiming for commercial success? Do you want to make a statement about a particular topic? Understanding your goals will help guide the development process.
5. *What are you trying to say* with this game idea? Think about the message or themes that you want to convey through the game. This could be anything from exploring mental health to promoting environmentalism. Understanding the message you want to convey will help you make design decisions that support that message.
6. How can this game be used to *showcase aspects of game development*? Consider how the game can be used to showcase particular aspects of game development in form of engaging video content. Is there a specific topic you could make an educational video about for other game devs while using this game idea as a practical example? Or what kind of video could reach a wider audience and introduce artists and art-interested people to the development process of games?
7. How can this game be used to *analyze the unique aspects of games as an artistic medium*? Similarly, consider how the game can be used to demonstrate the unique aspects of games as an artistic medium. This could include interactivity, player agency, or emergent gameplay. Here too you should focus on avoiding gate-keeping and try to find ways to draw in as many people as possible who may not be particularly familiar with games.
8. What are the *biggest challenges* for the making of this game? Consider the technical and design challenges that you will face in making the game. This could include anything from implementing a complex AI system to designing a user-friendly UI.
9. How well does this game *fit to your currently available resources*? Consider how well the game fits with your available resources, such as time, money, and team size. This will help you determine whether the game is feasible to develop given your current limitations.

> Once again, if you have trouble answering these questions, consider putting in more work into the concept or going back to the [Brainstorming](#brainstorming) section.

If you have answered all of the questions in a satisfying way, you are ready to move into [Pre-Production](2_PreProduction.md/#pre-production).
