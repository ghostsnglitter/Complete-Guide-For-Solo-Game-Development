## 1. Introduction

This guide is a complete documentation of my personal game development process for [`GHOSTS & GLITTER`](https://www.youtube.com/@ghostsnglitter). If you are an aspiring indie game developer of any skill level, this can serve as a blueprint or valuable reference. If you are a seasoned veteran, this may serve as little more than an interesting glimpse into my process - although any input from experts is welcome!

Specifically, this guide will cover the different phases of game development as I have defined them, with specific information on the various goals, tools used, strategies for organization, learning material, and useful resources - always with a focus on *solo* development.

My personal motivation for writing this guide was to find a process that works best with the kind of games i want to make and the kind of game developer i want to be, which is an ongoing effort with the following key principles:

```
Maximize
- Artistic freedom
- Flow
- Quality of final result
```

```
Minimize
- Cost (time, money, effort)
- Non-creative work
```

#### Important Notes

Before we go any further, a few important notes up front:
- This guide covers game development in Unity (although this is only really important for the production phase).
- I am writing this guide alongside the development of my first game, `SLINGSHOT`, which I will be using as an example throughout.

## 2. Phases of Game Development

This is the main part of the guide. What follows are short descriptions of the different phases of game development, with the titles linking to the detailed articles.

<a name="concept-phase"></a>
### 2.1 [Concept Phase](1_ConceptPhase.md/#concept-phase)

In the Concept Phase, you will funnel your many ideas into a single, clearly defined Game Concept and critically evaluate it. If you are satisfied, you will make the commitment to move into Pre-Production.

### 2.2 [Pre-Production](2_PreProduction.md/#pre-production)

During Pre-Production, you are going to hash out the most important design decisions. This is done through an iterative process of design and prototyping. You will also consider the resources that will be needed and draw up a plan for the realisation of your game - including an initial timeline - so that you can move on to Production.

<a name="production"></a>
### 2.3 [Production](3_Production.md/#production)

In Production, you will implement the specified design. This too is an interative process consisting of different stages, during which the design may need to be updated. The implementation is accompanied by consistent content preparation for public presentation of the game - with an increased commitment towards the release, which will mark the end of this phase.

<a name="post-release"></a>
### 2.4 [Post-Release](4_PostRelease.md/#post-release)

The Post-Release period is about updating and improving the game, engaging with the community, as well as potentially developing additional content.
